# Petful

A user interested in adopting pets can join a line to adopt.

Acceptance criteria

When A user visits the adoption page:

A user can see a list of other people currently in line.
A user submit my name and be added to the end of the line.

When a user is not at the beginning of the line, user cannot see an option to adopt a pet.

For demo purposes: Once user joins the line, I can see other pets being adopted until I am at the front of the line.

Every five seconds, the user at the front of the line should be removed from the line and one of the pets up for adoption should disappear.

When a user is at the front of the line, a new user should be added to the line behind me every five seconds until there are a total of five users in line.
